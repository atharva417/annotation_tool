# Annotation tool for YOLO
Instructions -

For python3 users in main.py replace the 10th and 11th line with-

"import tkinter

from tkinter import *

import tkinter.messagebox"

Place the images which are to be labelled in "Images/001/" folder.

Please do not change the names of the folder, the variables in the code are adjusted accordingly.

First run the main.py file. A new window would appear which will ask for the Image directory enter 001 for that, then start your work.



Like try to minimize the irrelevant part. 

After you are done with all images, then finally run convert.py

And upload the txt files in Lables/001s not Lables/001.
